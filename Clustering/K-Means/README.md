The code performs classification using the unsupervised, iterative algorithm K-Means clustering.  
This creates groups that have similar characteristics within the data.  

## How it works
> Compute centroids of the current clusters.
> Reassign the data points to the nearest cluster centroid.
> Repeat until there is little change in the location of the centroids.
